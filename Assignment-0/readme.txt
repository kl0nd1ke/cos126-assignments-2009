8.b


1. Collaboration on programming assignments.
   (a) Is not permitted.
   (b) Is permitted in the form of discussions of how to approach
       the problem and suggestions for how to debug.
   (c) Is permitted in the form of writing and debugging a program
       together in groups of no more than two.
   (d) Is permitted in the form of letting someone else write a program
       and then changing a few variable names then turning it in.

2. The typical penalty for submitting plagiarized code in a programming
   assignment is.
   (a) Zero for the assignment.
   (b) Failure in the course.
   (c) Hearing before the Committee on Discipline, suspension for 1 year.
   (d) Expulsion from the University.

3. The penalty for knowingly abetting an act of plagiarism (e.g., by giving
   another student a program to plagiarize) is, in principle,
   (a) No big deal.
   (b) Hearing before the Committee on Discipline, with penalties ranging
       from Academic Probation to Expulsion.

4. The penalty for unknowingly cooperating with someone (e.g., by leaving your
   programs in a publicly readable directory) is
   (a) The same as for knowing cooperation.
   (b) If you can convince the Committee on Discipline that the program
       was taken without your consent, they might let you off, but it
       would save a lot of trouble if you had protected the directory
       in the first place.

5. The penalty for giving someone hints about how to do a programming
   assignment and helping them interpret error messages is
   (a) No penalty, this is perfectly acceptable.
   (b) Hearing before the Committee on Discipline, probably get off
       with Academic Warning.

6. You may show another student the actual code of your solution to a
   programming assignment
   (a) If it's past the due date.
   (b) If they promise to look at it for reference only, then throw it
       away before writing their own solution.
   (c) If that student is helping you debug your program and that student
       is not currently taking COS126 (e.g., a lab TA).
   (d) If you are helping that student debug their program.
   (e) More than one of the above.
   (f) None of the above.

7. You may e-mail another student the actual code of your solution
   (a) Never a good idea.

8. We're dragging you through this exercise because
   (a) Princeton students can't be trusted.
   (b) Princeton students have great integrity but are often under
       severe time pressure and a clear understanding of the rules
       can never hurt.
